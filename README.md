# Udacity Flying Car and Autonomous Flight Engineer nanodegree

In this repository you can find my own solutions to the Flying Car Nanodegree Program projects.

## Core Curriculum

This section outlines the projects that you must finish in order to earn your certificate.

### Introduction to Autonomous Flight

The first project is called "Introduction to Autonomous Flight." In this course, you will gain  
an understanding of the history, challenges, and different types of vehicles used in flight.  
You will also become familiar with our quadrotor test platform and work in our custom simulator.  
The main goal of this project is to build a quadrotor that can successfully take off and fly  
around a backyard.
