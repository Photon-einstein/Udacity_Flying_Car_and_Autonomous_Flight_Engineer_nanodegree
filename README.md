# Udacity Flying Car and Autonomous Flight Engineer nanodegree

In this repository you can find my own solutions to the Flying Car Nanodegree Program projects.

## Core Curriculum

This section outlines the projects that you must finish in order to earn your certificate.

### Introduction to Autonomous Flight

The first project is called "Introduction to Autonomous Flight." In this course, you will gain  
an understanding of the history, challenges, and different types of vehicles used in flight.  
You will also become familiar with our quadrotor test platform and work in our custom simulator.  
The main goal of this project is to build a quadrotor that can successfully take off and fly  
around a backyard.

* **Project**: Backyard Flyer

### Planning

Autonomous drones need to navigate through tricky, ever-changing surroundings. Things like wind,  
obstacles, sensor glitches, and unpredictability make this task quite tough. In this class, you'll  
grasp the basics of planning flight paths for drones. You'll start by tackling simpler 2D scenarios,  
refine your approaches using strategic points, and then advance to dealing with the complexities of  
three-dimensional space. Your hands-on experience will come in your second assignment, where you'll  
guide your drone through a crowded cityscape all on its own.
