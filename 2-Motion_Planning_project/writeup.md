### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

You're reading it! Below I describe how I addressed each rubric point and where in my code each point is handled.

### Explain the Starter Code

#### 1. Explain the functionality of what's provided in `motion_planning.py` and `planning_utils.py`

The motion_planning.py script encompasses the plan_path() function, enabling the setting of target altitude and safety distance parameters, crucial for guiding the drone safely through its environment.

In planning_utils.py, the following essential functions are defined:

create_grid(): This function calculates and returns the minimal north and east coordinates required for the grid.  
valid_actions(): It determines the valid actions based on the grid coordinates and obstacles present in the environment.  
a_star(): Utilizing the A* algorithm, this function performs the search operation to find an optimal path.  
heuristic(): This function computes a numpy array considering the current position and the target position, aiding in pathfinding.  
read_home(): It reads the position from an input file and returns the latitude and longitude coordinates.  
collinearity_prune(): This function prunes the path points using collinearity, resulting in a refined path.  

Additionally, a notable distinction between backyard_flyer.py and motion_planning.py is the sequence of state   transitions.  
motion_planning.py incorporates additional states, namely PLANNING and TAKEOFF, compared to backyard_flyer.py.  

Upon testing and evaluating both scripts, it's evident that they share similar methods at a macro level.  
However, motion_planning.py introduces two distinct methods: send_waypoints() and plan_path().

In terms of performance, executing backyard_flyer_solution.py generates a square flight path for the drone.  
Conversely, when running motion_planning.py, the drone executes a takeoff, encounters obstacles, and safely  
lands back at its initial position.


1.1 Minimal requirement is to modify the code in planning_utils() to update the A* implementation  
to include diagonal motions on the grid that have a cost of sqrt(2), but more creative solutions are  
welcome. Explain the code you used to accomplish this step.

A* represents an algorithm designed to navigate through a search space, seeking the path or paths with  
the lowest cost. It achieves this by systematically exploring neighboring nodes, prioritizing those  
closer to the goal based on a heuristic estimate. In the context of our project, the A* algorithm endeavors  
to establish a route connecting the drone's initial position (start) to its target position (goal) within a  
3D grid map.

Before my modification to the valid_actions() function, the paths generated by the algorithm often featured  
numerous zigzagging diagonal movements. This occurred because the algorithm would connect two points through  
a third, effectively forming a triangle. However, by adjusting the cost of diagonal movements to sqrt(2),  
the algorithm consistently selects the more economical option, resulting in a straight-line connection between  
two points with a cost of only 1.

To implement this enhancement, I needed to update the Action class to accommodate four new diagonal actions.

* `NORTHWEST`
* `NORTHEAST`
* `SOUTHWEST`
* `SOUTHEAST`

With a cost of `sqrt(2)`. I also had to change the method `valid_actions()` so that the algorithm can remove  
the more costly diagonal actions of `sqrt(2)`

```
    if x-1 < 0 or y-1 < 0 or grid[x - 1, y - 1] == 1:
        valid_actions.remove(Action.NORTH_WEST)
    if x-1 < 0 or y+1 > m or grid[x - 1, y + 1] == 1:
        valid_actions.remove(Action.NORTH_EAST)
    if x+1 > n or y-1 < 0 or grid[x + 1, y - 1] == 1:
        valid_actions.remove(Action.SOUTH_WEST)
    if x+1 > n or y+1 > m or grid[x + 1, y - 1] == 1:
        valid_actions.remove(Action.SOUTH_EAST)
```


### Implementing Your Path Planning Algorithm

#### 1. Set your global home position
Here students should read the first line of the csv file, extract lat0 and lon0 as floating point values and use the self.set_home_position() method to set global home. Explain briefly how you accomplished this in your code.

The initial latitude (lat0) and longitude (lon0) values, extracted from a CSV file, are displayed below:

lat0: 37.792480
lon0: -122.397450

These values were retrieved by utilizing the genfromtext() function, with the CSV file location set previously through the set_home_position() method.

Location: motion_planning.py
```
filename = 'colliders.csv'
data = np.genfromtxt(filename, delimiter=',',max_rows=1,dtype=None)
lat0 = data[0]
lat0 = lat0[5:]
lat0 = np.array([lat0],dtype='Float64')
lon0 = data[1]
lon0 = lon0[5:]
lon0 = np.array([lon0],dtype='Float64')
print('lat0: {0}, lon0: {1}'.format(lat0, lon0))
# TODO: set home position to (lon0, lat0, 0)
self.set_home_position(float(lon0), float(lat0), 0)
```

#### 2. Set your current local position
Here as long as you successfully determine your local position relative to global home you'll be all set. Explain briefly how you accomplished this in your code.

I set the local position relative to the global home position using the following line:

```
global_position = [self._longitude, self._latitude, self._altitude]
current_local_position = global_to_local(global_position, self.global_home)
```

I have previously set the home position in the line:

```
self.set_home_position(float(lon0), float(lat0), 0)
```
The lan0 and lat0 where retrieved from the `.csv` file.

#### 3. Set grid start position from local position
This is another step in adding flexibility to the start location. As long as it works you're good to go!

I set the grid start position in the line:

```
grid_start = (int(-north_offset)+int(current_local_position[0]), int(-east_offset)+int(current_local_position[1]))
```

I have taken into consideration the north and east offset on the map to find the place in the grid.

#### 4. Set grid goal position from geodetic coords
This step is to add flexibility to the desired goal location. Should be able to choose any (lat, lon) within the map and have it rendered to a goal location on the grid.

The goal is established through the following lines of code:

```
goal_lon = -122.400511   
goal_lat = 37.792582
goal_alt = TARGET_ALTITUDE

global_goal_position = [goal_lon, goal_lat, goal_alt]
local_goal_position = global_to_local(global_goal_position, self.global_home)
grid_goal = (-int(north_offset) + int(local_goal_position[0]), -int(east_offset) + int(local_goal_position[1]) )
```

Here, the input coordinates are provided in geodetic format (-122.400511, 37.792582,0), from which local coordinates  
are derived using the global_to_local function.


#### 5. Modify A* to include diagonal motion (or replace A* altogether)
Minimal requirement here is to modify the code in planning_utils() to update the A* implementation to include diagonal motions on the grid that have a cost of sqrt(2), but more creative solutions are welcome. Explain the code you used to accomplish this step.

I have changed the selection of next moves in the A* to include diagonal motions:

The actions includes four new ones (diagonal) with cost `sqrt(2)`:

```
NORTH_WEST = (-1, -1, np.sqrt(2))
NORTH_EAST = (-1,  1, np.sqrt(2))
SOUTH_WEST = ( 1, -1, np.sqrt(2))
SOUTH_EAST = ( 1,  1, np.sqrt(2))
```

and in the `valid_actions` I have added:

```
    if x-1 < 0 or y-1 < 0 or grid[x - 1, y - 1] == 1:
        valid_actions.remove(Action.NORTH_WEST)
    if x-1 < 0 or y+1 > m or grid[x - 1, y + 1] == 1:
        valid_actions.remove(Action.NORTH_EAST)
    if x+1 > n or y-1 < 0 or grid[x + 1, y - 1] == 1:
        valid_actions.remove(Action.SOUTH_WEST)
    if x+1 > n or y+1 > m or grid[x + 1, y - 1] == 1:
        valid_actions.remove(Action.SOUTH_EAST)
```

#### 6. Cull waypoints 
For this step you can use a collinearity test or ray tracing method like Bresenham. The idea is simply to prune your path of unnecessary waypoints. Explain the code you used to accomplish this step.

I used collinearity to prune the path. The prunning algorithm looks like this:

```
    def prune_path(self,path):
        def point(p):
            return np.array([p[0], p[1], 1.]).reshape(1, -1)

        def collinearity_check(p1, p2, p3, epsilon=0.01):
            m = np.concatenate((p1, p2, p3), 0)
            det = np.linalg.det(m)
            return abs(det) < epsilon
            
        pruned_path = []
        #prune the path
        p1 = path[0]
        p2 = path[1]
        # add the start to the pruned path
        pruned_path.append(p1)
        for i in range(2,len(path)):
            p3 = path[i]
            if collinearity_check(point(p1),point(p2),point(p3)):
                p2 = p3
            else:
                pruned_path.append(p2)
                p1 = p2
                p2 = p3
        # add the end to the pruned path
        pruned_path.append(p3)


        return pruned_path
```

To streamline the path and eliminate unnecessary waypoints, various methods like collinearity tests or ray tracing  
(such as Bresenham) can be employed. 
Here, I'll explain the code utilized for this purpose.

The prune_path(self, path) function encompasses two subsidiary functions: point and collinearity_check.  
These functions contribute to generating an array of action points and cost functions.  

The point function's role is to create three new points for the subsequent iteration cycle. On the other hand,   
the collinearity_check function evaluates the collinearity of three points by computing the absolute values of    
the linearized determinant and comparing it with a predefined epsilon value. If the determinant falls within    
this epsilon threshold, indicating collinearity, the function disregards the upcoming point.    
Conversely, if the points are deemed non-collinear, implying a change in direction, an additional intermediate    
point will be incorporated into the path. This iterative process effectively refines the path by removing redundant    
waypoints.

# Extra Challenges: Real World Planning

For an extra challenge, consider implementing some of the techniques described in the "Real World Planning" lesson. You could try implementing a vehicle model to take dynamic constraints into account, or implement a replanning method to invoke if you get off course or encounter unexpected obstacles.
